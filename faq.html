              <p>
                All orders are shipped via DHL. First class/standard mails
                typically delivers within 3-5 business days after your tracking
                number has began updating. Priority mail deliver in 1-3 business
                days. Tracking numbers typically take around 24-48 hours to
                receive delivery information. Please note that adverse weather
                conditions and holidays may delay shipping. The
                <a href="https://www.dhl.com/en/express/tracking.html"
                  >DHL Tracking page</a
                >
                can provide up-to-date information on your shipment location.

              <h3>INTERNATIONAL</h3>

              <p>
                All orders are shipped via DHL. Please allow 7-21 days for
                delivery, depending on country. E-mail me for a delivery
                estimate. Your order may be subject to custom fees that you will
                be responsible for paying. If you reject custom fees and your
                package is returned you will be responsible for paying shipping
                fees to resend. We will not allow refunds on returns due to
                refusal to pay custom fees.
              </p>

            <dt>What's your return policy?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                All sales are final. No exchanges unless the wrong item was
                sent.

            <dt>How do I order wholesale?</dt>

            <dt>What if my package has been lost/stolen?</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                Most “lost/stolen” packages are not in fact missing or stolen.
                If your package fails to update or states it has been delivered
                and it wasn’t, contact DHL immediately as often times the
                package is still in their possession. If it is not and is indeed
                missing/stolen, continuing reading.
              </p>

              <p>
                DHL policy states if any shipment is failed to arrive, it is
                important that you contact customer service with an accurate
                description of the goods and their packaging as soon as
                possible. DHL “found shipment centers” hold on to items that
                were not properly addressed or that became detached from their
                packaging. It is possible that they will be able to reunite you
                with your shipment. If this fails, please DHL contact customer
                service to file a report.

                  result of inadequate packaging.</b
